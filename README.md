# Earth View

Earth View is an interactive satellite-imagery exploration app built with React, Vite, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS. It has two main working surfaces: a full-screen 3D globe for broad exploration, and a regional modal workspace for detailed inspection after a place has been selected.

The app is intentionally exploratory. Start in the globe view to orbit Earth, compare global NASA GIBS imagery layers, stack analytic overlays, and watch recent/open activity markers. When a location is worth a closer look, shift-click or right-click to open the modal view, where the same selected point becomes a pan/zoom regional image with date controls, layer switching, Sentinel imagery, scene metadata, and time-lapse tools.

## What It Does

- Renders an interactive 3D globe with NASA GIBS WMS imagery wrapped onto a Three.js sphere.
- Supports daily MODIS and VIIRS true-color and false-color base layers in the globe view.
- Supports NASA GIBS analytic overlays for aerosols, cloud-top temperature, precipitable water, sea surface temperature, chlorophyll, snow cover, sea ice, and active fires, with a single visibility toggle for the selected overlay stack.
- Supports regional Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 radar layers in detailed regional views.
- Shows toggleable country borders, state/province boundaries, graticule lines, and tiered city labels.
- Adds optional activity overlays for recent USGS earthquakes and open NASA EONET volcano and severe-storm events, with hover details for names, dates, recency, and severity where the feeds provide them.
- Switches into a higher-detail 2D imagery overlay when the camera reaches max zoom, with selected GIBS overlays and boundary lines carried into that detailed pass.
- Opens a regional imagery modal from shift-click or right-click selection.
- Supports date selection, layer switching, pan/zoom, and 7-day or 30-day regional time lapses.
- Requests Copernicus Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 radar imagery in the same regional modal through local/API server handlers.
- Provides Sentinel scene searches, scene-based time lapses, a five-year sampled comparison, and GIF export for Sentinel sequences.
- Includes server and client plumbing for an "Ask about this view" AI chat, although that UI is currently hidden behind a feature flag in `ImageryModal.tsx`.

## The Two Main Views

### Globe View

The globe view is the app's default surface. It is built around a Three.js Earth, NASA GIBS global WMS textures, and camera controls that report the currently visible center point and viewport span back into shared app state.

In this view, users can:

- Drag to orbit Earth and scroll or pinch to zoom. Holding Shift while scrolling applies a stronger zoom step for faster travel.
- Switch globe-capable base imagery from the floating imagery panel or number keys.
- Hide or show base imagery, boundary lines, or the selected analytic overlay stack from the compact icon controls in the imagery panel.
- Add, reorder, remove, clear, or temporarily hide GIBS analytic overlays. Overlay rows include loading/loaded status indicators, and the add menu only lists analytic `overlayOnly` providers rather than base imagery.
- Toggle activity overlays for earthquakes, volcanoes, and storms. Activity markers use dark-stroked shapes for contrast, with earthquakes and storms shown as crosshairs and volcanoes shown as X markers.
- Hover activity markers to inspect feed metadata. When marker hit areas overlap, the hovered event is chosen by whichever marker center is closest to the pointer.
- See graticule lines, country borders, admin-1 boundaries, and tiered city labels when boundary context is enabled.
- Enter a max-zoom 2D detailed imagery overlay when the camera gets close enough.
- Select a point with shift-click or right-click to open the modal view.

At max zoom, the app overlays a higher-detail regional image for the current viewport. That overlay can be dragged to pan the camera, and selecting a point from it preserves the visible regional span so the modal opens at a matching scale. The detailed pass also renders the active GIBS overlay stack as aligned regional WMS images, plus a NASA GIBS reference-features boundary overlay styled for contrast; both obey the globe-view visibility toggles.

Sentinel layers are regional-only providers. They can be selected once the app is operating at the detailed regional level, but they are not wrapped as true globe textures; the globe falls back to a global VIIRS true-color base while Sentinel imagery is rendered through the regional API flow.

### Modal View

The modal view is the detailed inspection workspace. It opens from a selected coordinate and focuses on a bounded regional image instead of the whole planet.

In this view, users can:

- Drag the regional image to pan.
- Scroll to zoom the regional image. Preview zoom/pan updates are immediate, while the committed bbox/image reload follows the latest settled interaction so repeated zooms and drags do not anchor on stale imagery.
- Shift-click to recenter the selected point.
- Change the active date.
- Switch between Sentinel, MODIS, VIIRS, and night-lights base imagery. Analytic GIBS products stay in the globe overlay system rather than appearing as standalone modal imagery choices.
- Open the imagery info dialog to compare layer purpose, resolution, caveats, and best use cases.
- Build 7-day or 30-day regional time lapses for daily GIBS layers.
- Build 7-mosaic, 30-mosaic, or five-year sampled time lapses for Sentinel layers.
- Export Sentinel time-lapse sequences as animated GIFs.

When the modal opens, the app stores the previous globe date, layer, manual-selection flags, and overlay stack. Closing the modal restores that prior globe state so regional inspection does not permanently disturb the broader globe context.

For Sentinel layers, the modal also searches contributing scenes near the selected date. When multiple acquisitions contribute to the rendered mosaic, the sidebar lists the scene acquisition times and Sentinel-2 cloud-cover values where available. Hovering or focusing a listed Sentinel scene can highlight that scene's footprint over the rendered mosaic when geometry is available, which helps connect mosaic seams back to contributing acquisitions.

## Data Sources

### NASA GIBS

The default imagery providers use NASA GIBS WMS:

- MODIS Terra true color
- MODIS Aqua true color
- VIIRS SNPP true color
- VIIRS NOAA-20 true color
- VIIRS SNPP SWIR false color
- VIIRS SNPP cloud/snow false color
- VIIRS NOAA-20 SWIR false color
- VIIRS Black Marble night lights
- MODIS aerosol optical depth
- MODIS cloud top temperature
- AMSR2 precipitable water
- GHRSST sea surface temperature
- MODIS chlorophyll-a
- MODIS snow cover
- AMSR2 sea ice concentration
- VIIRS active fires
- MODIS active fires

The main true-color and false-color GIBS layers can be used as globe base layers. The analytic GIBS products are registered as translucent overlays that can be stacked over the current base imagery and hidden or shown as one selected overlay stack. Some products are pinned to a fixed latest useful date in code when the public GIBS archive does not currently extend to today.

Most GIBS layers are treated as one complete global frame per day. The app defaults to the latest likely complete VIIRS NOAA-20 true-color day, with a small UTC lag to avoid requesting incomplete current-day imagery.

The global globe uses NASA GIBS WMS textures. Base imagery first requests a 4096-pixel-wide global frame and then upgrades to an 8192-pixel-wide frame when available. Analytic overlays on the 3D globe use global transparent GIBS textures, while the max-zoom detailed pass requests aligned regional overlay images for the current viewport.

The regional modal imagery provider list includes Copernicus Sentinel layers and non-overlay GIBS base layers. These layers use the same regional bbox, drag, and zoom workflow, but Sentinel requires Copernicus credentials and represents available scenes near the selected date rather than a global daily GIBS frame. GIBS analytic overlays are intentionally excluded from the modal layer switcher because they are overlay products, not standalone base imagery.

### Copernicus Sentinel

The regional Sentinel layers use Copernicus Data Space / Sentinel Hub APIs through server-side endpoints:

- Sentinel-2 true color
- Sentinel-2 false color infrared
- Sentinel-2 SWIR
- Sentinel-1 radar

Sentinel requests require API credentials. Without credentials, the NASA GIBS globe and regional views still work, but Sentinel rendering and Sentinel scene searches will return a configuration error.

### Event And Boundary Overlays

The globe fetches supporting context directly in the browser:

- Natural Earth country and admin-1 boundary GeoJSON, with fallback URLs
- USGS all-day earthquake GeoJSON, filtered to magnitude 2.5 and above
- NASA EONET open volcano events
- NASA EONET open severe-storm events, rendered as tracks when point history is available

These overlays are optional UI toggles. If a feed fails, the corresponding overlay simply renders no markers. Earthquake markers retain magnitude, depth, place, event time, update time, status, alert, and USGS links where available. EONET volcano and storm markers retain titles, geometry dates, source links, open/closed status, and storm intensity/track metadata where available. EONET volcano geometry dates are event observation/reporting dates, not verified last-eruption dates.

The app intentionally uses a plain dark globe background rather than generated stars or other decorative sky elements, so the scene stays focused on data-backed imagery and overlays.

### AI View Analysis

The codebase includes an experimental "Ask about this view" flow for OpenAI or Anthropic, but the UI is currently disabled by `ASK_VIEW_VISIBLE = false` in `src/components/Modal/ImageryModal.tsx`.

When enabled, the flow can open a chat seeded with:

- the currently displayed image
- selected coordinates and date
- capture-time label
- active satellite/provider/layer metadata
- current bbox, zoom degrees, and rendered image dimensions

The first request sends the current image. Follow-up requests keep the visible chat history plus a compact hidden view briefing, so the image does not need to be resent each turn. Responses stream back through a local/API server-sent-events endpoint.

The current default AI models are:

- OpenAI: `gpt-5.2` through the Responses API
- Anthropic: `claude-opus-4-1-20250805` through the Messages API

Both provider requests include web-search tools where supported. Anthropic web search must also be enabled for the organization in the Anthropic Console.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

For Sentinel support, fill in:

```bash
COPERNICUS_CLIENT_ID=
COPERNICUS_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

For the disabled AI view-analysis flow, fill in one or both provider keys if you plan to enable the UI or call the Ask View endpoints directly:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

Older Sentinel Hub variable names are also supported by the server code, although `.env.example` only lists the preferred Copernicus names:

```bash
SENTINELHUB_CLIENT_ID=
SENTINELHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=
```

Run the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite serves the app on `127.0.0.1` by default.

## Scripts

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the Vite dev server with local Sentinel API middleware
npm run build    # Type-check and build the production bundle
npm run preview  # Preview the production build locally
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

## How To Use The App

### Globe View

- Drag the globe to rotate Earth.
- Scroll or pinch to zoom; hold Shift while scrolling for a moderately faster zoom step.
- Use the imagery panel or number keys to switch available base layers.
- Use the three compact imagery-panel toggles to hide or show base imagery, boundary lines, and the selected overlay stack.
- Add GIBS analytic overlays from the overlay selector, reorder them, remove them, clear the overlay stack, or keep the selected stack hidden without removing it.
- Hover overlay candidates to read a dark summary card before adding them, and watch overlay rows for loading/loaded status.
- Toggle activity overlays for earthquakes, volcanoes, and storms.
- Hover activity markers for event details. Earthquake marker color tracks magnitude, volcanoes use a distinct X marker, and storm tracks show the latest storm head.
- At max zoom, the app replaces the globe view with a higher-detail regional image for the current viewport, while keeping visible overlays and boundary lines aligned over that image.
- Shift-click or right-click the globe or max-zoom image to select a point and open the imagery modal.
- Use max-zoom drag gestures to pan the detailed overlay before selecting a point.

### Modal View

- Drag to pan the regional image.
- Scroll to zoom the regional image.
- Shift-click to recenter on a new point without leaving the modal.
- Change the date, switch base imagery layers, or open the imagery info dialog from the sidebar.
- Use number keys to switch layers while the modal is open.
- Use 7-day and 30-day time-lapse controls for daily GIBS imagery.
- Use 7-mosaic, 30-mosaic, and five-year sampled time-lapse controls for Sentinel imagery.
- Hover listed Sentinel scenes to highlight the scene footprint on the rendered mosaic when geometry is available.
- Download Sentinel time-lapse sequences as GIFs.
- Close the modal to restore the globe's previous date, layer, manual-selection state, and overlay stack.

Sentinel layers are listed first in the modal layer switcher, followed by non-overlay GIBS base imagery. Analytic overlay-only products are omitted from the modal list. Sentinel layers require Copernicus credentials and may take longer to render than GIBS WMS layers because they go through the server/API Sentinel Process and Catalog flows.

## Architecture Notes

### Rendering Flow

`src/components/Globe/Globe.tsx` owns the Three.js canvas. It builds global NASA GIBS texture URLs for globe-capable providers, renders the Earth sphere, applies optional transparent GIBS overlay textures, mounts boundary/city/event overlays, and reports camera-derived viewport information back to the Zustand store. Regional-only Sentinel providers keep the globe on a default global true-color texture while the regional modal renders the selected Sentinel layer.

Globe camera controls adapt interaction speed by camera distance. Scroll zoom and drag/pan slow down near the globe surface so close exploration is less sensitive, while wider globe navigation remains responsive. A capture-phase Shift+wheel handler applies a stronger zoom step for intentional fast zooming without changing normal wheel behavior.

`src/components/Globe/MaxZoomImagery.tsx` listens for max-zoom globe state. When the camera is close enough, it requests a regional image for the visible bounding box and presents it as a 2D overlay. This allows clearer local inspection than stretching the global sphere texture. It also draws selected GIBS overlays as transparent regional WMS images and draws NASA GIBS `Reference_Features` boundaries with a white line and dark halo when boundary lines are enabled.

`src/components/Globe/CameraHotkeys.tsx` owns the floating imagery panel, number-key layer switching, base imagery visibility, boundary visibility, GIBS overlay stack visibility, GIBS overlay stack controls, and activity overlay toggles. It separates base imagery from analytic overlays by using `overlayOnly`, displays overlay texture load status, and renders dark readable hover summaries for overlay candidates.

`src/components/Globe/EventOverlays/` owns activity feeds and marker behavior. `ActivityCrosshair.tsx` renders dark-stroked marker shapes and invisible square hit targets, `activityHoverStore.ts` tracks the active marker, `ActivityHoverPopup.tsx` renders feed metadata over the globe, and `eventDetails.ts` centralizes event date/age formatting.

### Selection And Modal State

`src/store/useAppStore.ts` is the central state store. It tracks:

- selected coordinates
- current globe viewport
- active imagery layer
- active GIBS overlay layers
- boundary and GIBS overlay visibility flags
- overlay load statuses
- activity overlay toggles
- selected date
- modal open/closed state
- imagery zoom level
- camera focus requests

`src/components/Modal/ImageryModal.tsx` is the main inspection workspace. It keeps the dialog layout and control wiring in one place, while `src/components/Modal/hooks/` owns the focused behavior for pane sizing, object URL cleanup, regional imagery loading, Sentinel scene requests, drag and zoom interactions, and time-lapse orchestration.

`src/components/Modal/AskViewModal.tsx` owns the hidden AI chat UI. It captures the current rendered image as a data URL, sends it with structured view metadata, streams assistant text into the chat, and preserves a compact hidden view briefing for follow-up questions. If the current imagery position, date, layer, or zoom changes while the chat is open, the chat can show a stale-context notice and restart against the new view. This code is present, but `ImageryModal.tsx` currently hides it with `ASK_VIEW_VISIBLE = false`.

### Imagery Providers

Regional imagery follows a provider interface in `src/types/imagery.ts`. `GibsProvider` implements that interface by producing WMS `GetMap` URLs and can be marked `overlayOnly` for analytic products that should stack over a base layer. `SentinelProvider` implements the same interface by requesting Sentinel imagery through the server/API layer. The registry in `src/providers/registry.ts` is the main place to add, remove, or reorder base, overlay, and regional layers. `modalImageryProviders` keeps Sentinel first and then includes only non-overlay GIBS base imagery.

Sentinel imagery is modeled separately in `src/lib/sentinelVariants.ts` because each layer needs a Copernicus collection, resolution, request window, and evalscript.

### Sentinel Server Layer

`src/server/sentinel.ts` contains the shared server logic for both local development and deployment:

- credential lookup
- access-token caching
- request validation
- Sentinel Process API image rendering
- Sentinel Catalog API scene searches
- scene de-duplication by minute
- cloud filtering for Sentinel-2

Sentinel 7-scene and 30-scene time lapses search a larger pool of catalog candidates, then render the latest usable distinct scenes so cloud filtering and de-duplication do not prematurely cap the sequence.

During local development, `vite.config.ts` mounts this logic as middleware at:

- `POST /api/sentinel-image`
- `POST /api/sentinel-scenes`

For Vercel-style deployments, the same functions are exposed from `api/sentinel-image.ts` and `api/sentinel-scenes.ts`.

### AI Server Layer

`src/server/askView.ts` contains the shared server logic for local development and deployment:

- request validation and API-key checks
- view-context prompt construction
- OpenAI Responses API calls
- Anthropic Messages API calls
- optional web-search tool configuration
- streamed response parsing
- hidden `VIEW_BRIEFING` extraction for follow-up turns

During local development, `vite.config.ts` mounts this logic as middleware at:

- `POST /api/ask-view`
- `POST /api/ask-view-stream`

For Vercel-style deployments, the same functions are exposed from `api/ask-view.ts` and `api/ask-view-stream.ts`.

## Adding A New Imagery Layer

For a NASA GIBS WMS layer:

1. Add a new `GibsProvider` entry in `src/providers/registry.ts`.
2. Set the GIBS `layerId`, display metadata, satellite, category, nominal resolution, and caveats.
3. Non-overlay layers automatically appear in the globe hotkey panel, modal layer switcher, and imagery info dialog.

For a NASA GIBS overlay:

1. Add a new `GibsProvider` entry in `src/providers/registry.ts`.
2. Set `overlayOnly: true` so it appears in the overlay selector instead of the base-layer or modal imagery lists.
3. Use `fixedDate` when a product has a known archive end date that should override the selected app date.

For a Sentinel layer:

1. Add a new entry in `src/lib/sentinelVariants.ts`.
2. Provide the collection, nominal resolution, request window, metadata, and evalscript.
3. Confirm `src/server/sentinel.ts` supports the required collection-specific `dataFilter` and processing options.

For a regional Sentinel provider:

1. Add or update a provider in `src/providers/` that implements the shared imagery provider interface.
2. Request the matching Sentinel variant through the local/API endpoints.
3. Register the provider in `src/providers/registry.ts`.

## Deployment Notes

The app is a Vite SPA with serverless-style Sentinel and AI endpoints. The static build is produced by `npm run build`; deployment environments must also provide Sentinel credentials if Sentinel rendering should work and AI provider keys if the hidden Ask View UI is enabled or the Ask View endpoints are called directly.

NASA GIBS imagery, boundary GeoJSON, USGS earthquakes, and NASA EONET event feeds are fetched directly by the browser. Sentinel and AI credentials are never sent to the browser; they are read only by the server/API layer.

## Current Notes

`NOTES.md` contains short working notes and possible follow-up tasks. It is not required for running the app, but it is useful project context for current ideas around AIS ship tracks, OPERA/ASF Sentinel-1 RTC products, and Sentinel mosaic scene highlighting.
